 <P>they eat  fish and large sea mammals (animals with hair) such as dolphins and seals and they also eat turtles and seagulls, or even other sharks! And because their teeth and jaws are so strong, it's no problem for sharks to chew or rip through tough skin, bones, or hard shells but most sharks primarily feed on smaller fish and invertebrates. Some of the larger shark species prey on seals, sea lions, and other marine mammals. Sharks have been known to attack humans when they are confused or curious.</P>
