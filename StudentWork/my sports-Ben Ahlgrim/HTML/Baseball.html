                <p class="joe">My favorite part of baseball is playing infield perferabily 2nd base. when hitting i am the first in the order because i can get on base a lot of the times.</p>
                <p>there have been many moments I have been proud but my favorite was when my competitive team won states 2 years in a row.</p>
