        <p class="Introduction">Stanford University is a dream college for a lot of people. Stanford has some of the best athletics and sports in the nation. They also have a very nice campus. To get into Stanford you need to have really really good grades, and be a really well rounded person. They often don't give out scholarships for just being a great athlete unless they know you'll go pro, so this means you need to have teh grades to back it up. In 2022 over 56,000 students applied to Stanford and the university only accepted 2,075 applicants. This means that less than 4 in 100 students are accepted to Stanford, so to get in you really need to be te best of the best. </p>
