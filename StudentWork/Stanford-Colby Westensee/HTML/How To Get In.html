        <div class="GettingIn">

        <p>Stanford is one of the best schools in the country, and so many people apply every year, and only the best of the best can get in, less than 4% get in. You need to have outstanding grades and be a well rounded person. Most people that get into Stanford have a GPA from a 3.9-4.0. Infact, over 75% of students who gain admission to Stanford have 4.0 GPAs. Although colleges can give you a scholarship and a full ride to play a sport, Stanford doesn't do that as much as they value education. However, they could make an acception if they were very certain that you would go pro in that sport and you still had a reasonable GPA. When trying to get into Stanford you should try to make yourslef stand out from teh rest of the applicants, because there will be a lot of people applying. You need to be able to demonstrate that you would be a great addition to Stanford university.</p>
