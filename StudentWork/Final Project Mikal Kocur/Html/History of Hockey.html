            <p> 1877 - McGill University in Montreal forms the first organized hockey team on January 31. On February 27, the Montreal Gazette publishes the first rules - seven in all - for hockey. The rules are based on field hockey rules.</p>
            <p> 1881 - The McGill University team poses at Montreal's Crystal Palace Rink for what would be the world's first photograph of a hockey team.</p>

            <p> 1981 - The Soviet Union beats Sweden 13-1 in the most lopsided World Championship decider and goes on to defeat Team Canada 8-1 in the one-game Canada Cup final in Montreal, arguably the most crushing defeat in Canada's international hockey history.  </p>
