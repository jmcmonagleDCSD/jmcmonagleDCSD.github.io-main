            <h1>Bars</h1>

            <p>Bars is an event where you need a lot of core and arm strength. There are many routines you can do on bars, here is an example: Kip cast double back hip circle, squat on jump to high bar, tap swing, tap swing flyaway dismount. A bar routine takes a long time to learn, and if it is not executed correctly, there can be major deductions at competitions.  </p>
