        <div class="Strategies">Strategies For Fishing
        <p>There are lots of types of strategies you can do when fishing, for example casting in a area where the curent of the water isn't fast. When thinking where you should cast your line, dont go past a fish bed. A fish bed is a ideal place to fish because the fish are spawning and tend to be very agressive. Another place you shouldn't pass when your fishing a river is right behind a big bolder or rock. This is a good spot to try because thats where fish are usually going to go when they are tired of fighting the current when swimming. Also another good place to try is in a area where the current is barely or not moving at all. This is also another place fish go when they are tired of fighting the current.   </p>
