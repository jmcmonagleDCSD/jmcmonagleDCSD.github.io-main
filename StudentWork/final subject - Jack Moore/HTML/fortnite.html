            <li><h2>Landing</h2>
            <p>Where you land is very important. Landing at an unnamed location is the safest bet, especially if it's on the edge of the map. But if you land at the edge of the map your most likely going to have to run from the storm. Landing at vaults can get you some good loot but there are 2 different types of vaults. The best type of vault is at named locations with a medalion, to openit you must kill the boss who has multiple guards. Kill the boss, pick up medalion (and mythic weapon if you want), then find the vault, open it and boom you get a ton of loot and access to a weapon mod bench. There is also a different vault at no named locations, that you just kill a single guard (who doesn't have a mythic or medalion), then open up a vault that also has loot but not as much as at the named locations and no mod bench. If you don't want a vault there is still a huge map to land at.</p></li>

            <li><h2>Loot</h2>
            <p>What you use is totally up to you and how you play. You can use spray and spam weapons or strategic or something like that. There are<ul> <li>ARs</li> <li>shotguns</li> <li>SMGs</li> <li>pistols</li> <li>a riot shield</li> <li>grapple blade</li> <li>sniper</li> <li>sticky cluster grenades(cluster clingers)</li></ul> All in the weapon loot pool with most weapons having weapon mods like scopes, mags, underbarrels, and muzzels. <div class="heals"> the normal heals along with flowberryfizz and flowberries for healing.</div> Lastly, there are Medalions are also powerful healing artifacts that the more you have, the more shield it heals but also, the better everyone knows where you are.</p></li>
            <li><h2>Building</h2>
            <p>Building is a key feature in Fortnite, if you play zero build then you can skip this. You can build walls, ramps, floors/roofs, and cones. Each type with their own edits. You can make all of those out of either wood, stone, or metal. To get those materials you need to use your pickaxe to destroy every thing you can. Killing people in game will drop materials that you can use.</p></li>
            <li><h2>Storm</h2>
            <p>The storm is used to avoid long matches and camping by doing damage to people inside. It does more damage as the match goes on. Sometimes getting away can be hard but being inside the white circle on the map means your safe. You can use shockwaves, the grapple blade, or cars to get away.
