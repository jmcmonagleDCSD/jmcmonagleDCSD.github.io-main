        <h1>Minecraft survival</h1>
        <h2><p>1. Mining</p></h2>
        <p>You need to get blocks if you wanna play considering the game is all about breaking, crafting, and placing blocks. You need to start by breaking a tree or if you want you break other blocks you can break with your hand. You can make a crafting table and make tools to get stone to then iron to diamond then to the ore I'll talk about later. You can also build with the blocks you mine. </p>
        <h2><p>2. Tools</p></h2>
        <p>As I said, you can make tools with the blocks you break and need tools to break more blocks. You can make swords, pickaxes, axes, shovels, and hoes. You can use swords and axes to fight. Pickaxes, shovels, and axes are used to collect blocks. Hoes are used to farm for food.</p>
        <h2><p>3. night time</p></h2>
        <p>Night is when monsters come out. They will try and kill you or if it's a creeper, blow everything up. To stop them you need to fight, hide, or sleep before they spawn. I will go over what to do in the next 4 steps.</p>
        <h2><p>4. difficulty</p></h2>
        <p>Minecraft has difficulties that range from peaceful-hard.</p> 
        <ol>
            <li>Peaceful, you will not lose hunger and nothing will attack (monsters also won't spawn).</li> 
            <li>Easy, your hunger bar will go down but you won't starve to death, monsters will spawn and attack, and nuetral mobs will attack if damaged by you.</li>
            <li>medium, </li>
            <li>Hard, </li> 
        </ol>
        <p>bonus. hardcore, hard mode just with extra mobs and even worse, no respawns.</p>
        <h2><p>5. building</p></h2>
        <p>In Minecraft, building is the main thing. You do it for fun, for protection, and/or other reasons. You need to so you can store your valuables safely and keep your self safe. Doing it to build something cool is also viable and fun.</p>
        <h2><p>6. fighting</p></h2>
        <p>Fighting is the only way to survive if hiding isn't availble. Using a sword or axe as a weapon is your best choice for melee, they both do good damage. If you play on bedrock (playstation, xbox, nintendo, and the other computer versions) it's recomended to use a sword or trident if your far enough. On Java (main computer version) it's recomended to use an axe and not spamming because it isn't useful and instead you should wait for the cooldown to end to do the most damage. You can also make a bow or crossbow for a ranged attack, you can make normal arraows but also give them potion effects to give them a certain effect. Shields were added in the 1.9 (combat update) where if you have it in your offhand you can crouch to be able to block attacks. Armor can be made and will protect you by making you take less damage.</p>
        <h2><p>7. sleeping</p></h2>
        <p>Sleeping is very useful for avoiding monsters. Sleeping in a bed sets your respawn point at that bed but if bed is destroyed or moved it will need to be interacted with or you won't be respawned at it anymore. Placing your bed in a building is recomended to protect it from being destroyed or you being spawn killed. If you don't sleep three nights in a row, bird like things will spawn, with more spawning every night with no sleep, that will attack you called phantoms and when killed by you they will drop a phantom membrane which is used to repair your elytra (wings) which is found in end citys after you beat the game. You can not use beds in the nether or end, they will just blow up and kill you. In the nether you can use a respawn anchor which will make you respawn in the nether but needs to be charged with glowstone.</p>
        <h2><p>8. enchantments</p></h2>
        <p>You can enchant alomost anything and make things do more damage, break slower, etc. You can apply them using an enchantment table but each one costs levels and lapis lazuli. There are currently 40 enchantments in Minecraft that all do different things. There also levels of enchantments that make the enchantment do what they do, but better. On armor you can put: protection and it's types, their special enchantments, and thornes. On weapons you can put: sharpness, fire aspect, their special enchantments, and knockback. On tools you can put: efficiancy, silk touch, fortune, and knockback. I recomend putting knockback on pickaxes so when mining if something sneaks up on you, you can hit it away giving you time to pull out a weapon.</p> 
        <p>Some enchantments are universal like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>mending-XP repairs what you equiped</li>
            <li>unbreaking-tools and armor lose less durability</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><p>9. anvils</p></h2>
        <p>You can use anvils to apply certain enchantments from books, to name things, or to repair tools and armor. Your tools and armor wear down after using them and eventually break. Repairing them is possible, using 1-4 of the same material the tool or piece of armor is made of you can repair it on the anvil. If you get a nametag from somewhere, you can put it on the anvil and name it, after that you can use it on an animal or monster and it will be named and no longer despawn. If you get an enchanted book, you can put it on any tool or piece of armor that accepts that enchantment. Also you can combine tools and armor with the same tool or pice of armor as long as they are the same material and type and it will come out as one of the same exept with the durabilities are combined and so are the enchantments and if the enchantments have two that are exactly the same they will combine and go up one level.</p>
