        <div class="growingup">
            <h3>Birth to Now</h3>
            <p>I was born in Yuma, Arizona since I was born while my parents took care of my great grandma.
             At around two years old my great grandma died so we moved to Parker, Colorado where my parents already had a house.
              Ten years later I was twelve and I moved to Castle Rock, Colorado and learned how to code.<br><br>Fun Fact: this is my final project in my coding class!

            <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
            <p>I love playing videogames and always have evr since before I can remember. 
                I played a lot of Minecraft and played lego games with my dad when I could.
                 When I went to school I learned about Fortnite and loved it.
                 In recent years I'm playing all kinds of games like Call of Duty, Fortnite, Minecraft, and more.
                I'm recently getting into Youtube and making videos or your seeing this later when I post this website if I even can.
            I also like playing videogames (especially horror games) at my friends house.
        If we're playing at our houses then Fortnite is our main choice.</p>

            <h3>Outdoor Hobbies</h3>
            <p>I like sports and hanging out with my friends when I'm outside.
                I play football  as a linemen and I'm training to be a quarterback or running back. 
                If I'm alone outside I like playing basketball with the hoop I have.
                I like riding my bike or scooter with my friends around my neighberhood.
