            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>The unusual appearance of this egg-laying, duck-billed, beaver-tailed, otter-footed mammal at first baffled European naturalists. In 1799, the first scientists to examine a preserved platypus body judged it a fake made of several animals sewn together</p>
            <p>The common name "platypus" literally means 'flat-foot', deriving from the Greek word plat√∫pous</p>

        <div class="boxthree">
            <h2>Breeding Behaviors</h2>
            <p>The female spends most of this time with her young in the burrow, and as the young grow, she increasingly leaves them to forage. Towards the end of the summer the young emerge from the burrow</p>
            <p>After mating, a pregnant female builds a nest in a long complex burrow in less than a week.</p>
