        <h2>Where do Platypuses Live?</h2>
        <p>Platypus are found in eastern Australia from the steamy tropics of far north Queensland to the freezing snows of Tasmania. In Queensland, platypus live in rivers east of the Great Dividing Range, and are also found in some western-flowing streams. In north Queensland, the range of the platypus is close to the coast.</p>

        <h2>Habitat Facts</h2>
        <p>The Platypus spends most of the time in its burrow in the bank of the river, creek or a pond.</p>
        <p>At times, the individuals use rocky crevices and stream debris as shelters, or they burrow under the roots of vegetation near the stream.</p>
        <p>The ideal habitat for the species includes a river or a stream with earth banks and vegetation.</p>

        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>Crepuscular and semi-aquatic, they prefer rivers and streams with beds suitable for digging burrows.</p>
        <p>Platypuses habitat is in freshwater creeks, slow-moving rivers, lakes joined by rivers, and dams. They build a burrow in a river bank that's just above water level and usually among tree roots.</p>
        <p>Platypuses find both prey and river banks to dig resting and nesting burrows.</p>
