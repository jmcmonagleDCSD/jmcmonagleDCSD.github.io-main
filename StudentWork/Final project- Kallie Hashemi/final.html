<p>       Elephants are an animal that weigh around 13,000 pounds! They mostly live in savannas, grasslands, and even forests. 
    They are the largest land animal and are very kind and gentle,
    they are also one of the smartest animals ever! They have been compared to have the same IQ as dolphines, chimps,
    and other monkeys. But they are going endangered because of poachers (people that hunt Elelphants), they kill about 20,000
    elephants every year just for their tusks. It is illegal to poach elephants but people still do and then sell them on the black market.
