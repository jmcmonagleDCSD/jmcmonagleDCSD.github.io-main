        <!--Class makes it so you can indivudually style what ever your class says. In css to style a class you have to make a class in html then in css do .(what ever you named your class)-->
        <p class="info">If you want to rank up you need to practice before you play any games when you get on. You also need to watch some videos on the best playstyle. Last you need to play strategically and confident to win all of you fights.</p>

            <p>This character we will name Jamo. Now Jamo doesn't know how to build, don't be like Jamo, learn to build.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="bcd"> Still if you want to rank up without trying to get better at the game just do what Bushcampdad does or what LazarBeam did. They both avoided all fights and tried to stay alive throughout the game which got them more points even though they didn't get any kills </p>
