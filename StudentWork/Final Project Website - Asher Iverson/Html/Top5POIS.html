        <h1>Top 4 places to land in Fortnite</h1>

        <hr>

        <div class="si">
            <h2>Stark Industries</h2>
            <p>I know Stark industries isn't in the game anymore but when it was it was the best place to land ever. It was the best because of the crazy OP chests and mythic that you got for killing the boss.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="ta">
            <h2>The Agency </h2>
            <p>The Agency had what was known as the most broken and best mythic back in chapter 2 season 2. It was the best because of the high damage and the fast fire rate. It was really saut after and some games the hole lobby may be at the agency trying to get their hands on the drum gun.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="ss">
            <h2>Snooty Steps</h2>
            <p>Snooty Steps is one of the most contested POI's in the game right now. It is so contested becuase of all the chests and loot there is. It also has the best mythic in the game which is Peter Griffans Hammer Pump Shotgun. It is so good because of the high damage and it also comes with a madalion.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="sl">
            <h2>Slurpy Swamps</h2>
            <p>Slurpy Swamps is a great place to land because of the slurp barrels and the slurp river that can heal your shield and HP. Each barrel gives you 10 shield/HP and if you farm 10 of them at the start of a match without getting shot you will have full shield and HP. It also have a very diverse amount of chests and spots next to it you can go to, to farm materials or loot up more.</p>
