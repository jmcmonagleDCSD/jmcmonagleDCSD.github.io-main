        <h1>Mythics</h1>

        <hr>

        <div class="pg">
            <h2>Peter Griffan</h2>
            <p>Peter Griffan Mythic is regarded to be the best mythic in the game because not only does he have a medalion he also has the mythic shotgun which is known to be the best shotgun in the new meta of fortnite. But if you are not very good at the game I wouldn't try and land on Peter at the beggining of the match and landing somewhere safe to loot up then you can go fight the person that killed peter.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="ff">
            <h2>Fencing Fields</h2>
            <p>Fencing Fields mythic is also one of the best mythics in the game because it comes with a purple hammer pump and the mythic is an AR which is very versitile when it comes to fighting. It can be used in close range, long range, and medium rang. It can also be used to take someones wall if they are in a box, you just need to spray the wall and then when it breaks quickly switch to your wall build and place it where their wall would have been before you broke it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="ll">
            <h2>Lavish Lair</h2>
            <p>The Lavish lair mythic is the best mythic for zero build players because you can just run into their face with and since it is an auto shotgun you can just spray it into their body and kill them in 3 hits. Since it's zero build they can't build and heal and they will just run which is when you start shooting them with a SMG or an AR depending on what you have in your inventory.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rr">
            <h2>Reckless Railway</h2>
            <p>Reckless Railway mythic is good for spraying people cloes and sometimes medium range but if you are trying to spray at someone from long range it won't be as effective so you might want to rock an AR to help with the long range fights or just try and close the gape between you and your enemy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="gg">
            <h2>Grand Glaicer</h2>
            <p>The Grand Glaicer mythic has to be the worst mythic they have ever added to the game, you can never hit you shots with it and no one wants it. The only reason you would land at grand glaicer is to get a medalion because hardly anyone goes there becuase of how bad the mythic is. Also if you try and rush the valut after you get the medalion you might want to watch out because there could be people camping it and waiting for you.</p>
