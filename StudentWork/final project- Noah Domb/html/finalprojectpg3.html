        <h1>this season has been classified as the worst fortnite season of all time. i firmly believe that the best weapon of this season was the spire assassins primal shotgun as it was the most overpowered weapon in the game.</h1>

        <H1>the season didnt have many good weapons, and overall added nothing. the makeshift shotgun is without a doubt the worst shotgun we will ever have in the game. it held 3 shots and only did a max shot of 120. not to mention that it was the most inaccurate gun in the game. (this is slightly debatable)</H1>
