        <p>Boosting is mainly effective when you get to late mid game and endgame. Usually Blue hives boost in pinetree, Red hives boost in pepper, and white hives boost in coconut and spider. Boosting is when you donate to the windshrine to get winds for a feild, use loaded dice, and glitter to get a 4X for the feild you are boosting in, and finnaly using usually a super smoothie, so you can get the effects of a red extract, glue, and oil for 20 minutes. When you are boosting you spend ruffly 20-30 minutes getting as much honey as you can!</p>
