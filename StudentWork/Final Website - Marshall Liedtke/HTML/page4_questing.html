        <div class="Why">
            <h2>Why should you worry about doing quests?</h2>

            <p>You should do quests becase they are very easy ways to progress in the game. Quests can be very easy, but they give good rewards, such as when you complete the final black bear quest Myth in the making, you get a mythic egg.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="how">
            <h2>witch ones should you prioritize</h2>

            <P>In the "how to grind"page i talked about doing quests, but how should you do them. When you first start doing quests you should be prioritizing black bear quests. You should do this because his quests are very easy and they give good rewards. You should also have mother bear quest becuase they are very easy to complete just by playing the game. When you get to scnince bear you should start doing these quest while you do black bear quests because they both are very good quests. When you reach 30 bees and start doing star jurney from onnet, you should start to prioritize these quest because they are not that hard for the level you should be at, and they give very good rewards. When you get to 35 quests, you should start doing spirit bear quests and prioritize these over everything else untill you get the first spirit petal, then you should go back to blakc bear becuase you will be close to completing his quest line.</P>
