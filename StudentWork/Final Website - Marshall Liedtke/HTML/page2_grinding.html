        <div class="How">
            <h2> How to grind</h2>
            <p>When you are grinding you need to work on many things at a time. When you start the game you want to do many black bear quests while you spend honey mainly on bees and leveling them up. When you start leveling up bees you must have mother bear quests because when you get to the quest "7 to 7" you get a star egg and when you get to the quest "the final family" you get a star treat. While you are doing black bear quest, you want to go to the noob shop to buy new equipment so you can complete the quests faster. When you get all of the best things in the noob shop, you want to get 10 bees so you can go to the next shop. and you can keep repeting thes quests. By the time you get 10 bees you should be getting better, and you should start doing scince bear quests. Scince bear quests are very good becuase you can get 3 translators from them, allowing you to talk to Buko bee, riley bee, and stick bug. Scince bear quest should be things you do in the background but when you are clsoe to completing them you should work on them. </p>
