         <h2>McLaren P1 LM GTR</h2>
        <p>my favorite car of the mix is the mclaren p1 LM GTR. this track devil isnt even street legal, but instead reserved for just the track, however you could try to get your hands on one of the even rarer McLaren P1 Lm's which is the street legal version.  the McLaren p1 LM GTR has an impressive 986 horsepower engine which is about 10 times the horsepower of a normal
        family car</p>

        <p>the Mclaren P1 Lm GTR is a speed demon reaching speeds of 217 mph</p>
        <p>the mclaren p1 lm GTR isnt street legal but instead reserved for the track, this is because its too fast and too dangerous for other drives on the street, it also doesnt meet the requierments needed to be street legal, these include not having front indicators, and more missing features that had to be changed with the McLaren p1 Lm.</p>
        <h2>McLaren F1 LM</h2>
        <p>the Mclaren F1 LM is a great car with great speed reacing speeds faster than the P1 LM</p>

        <p>the mclaren f1 LM is a speed killler as its top speed is 225 mph this is incredible for a street legal car, and for any car. the creator of this beauty was a formula one desiner, he intended to make the ultimate street legal car, and indeed he did. this beast has a beastly 680 horsepower engine, this might not be as impressive as the p1 you have to think about weight, shape, and the downforce, all of theese factors play a role in speed and controllabillity</p>
