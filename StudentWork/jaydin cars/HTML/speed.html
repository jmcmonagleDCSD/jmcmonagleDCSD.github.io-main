        <h1>how cars work</h1>
        <h2>cars have a battery, engine, muffler, exhaust pipe, fuel tank, brakes, transmission, catalyc converter, and axles. </h2>
        <h2>the batery is simple all it is really used for is starting the car, now the engine is a bit more complex, the engine takes the fuel put into the gas tank and converts that feul into energy used for the car, the muffler helps dampen the sound of the emmisions and the engine, the exaust pipe is also very simple it collects the exaust gasses from the vehicle and points it away from its accupants, the feul tank gets filled and propelled through a feul pipe to the engine, the brakes are pressed agaist a metal disk connected to the wheel stopping them but this only works because they have rubber pads on them called brake pads theese are used to create friction on the metal thus slowing down the vehicle</h2>
        <p>all of this information is cool but unnesissary for explaining speed, speed is reached by the shape of the car</p>
        <h1>downforce</h1>
        <p>downforce is what helps the car travel at higher speeds, it does this by increasing vertical force on the tires, increasing grip </p>
        <p>downforce also counteracts lift thus keeping the car on the ground instead of lifting and flipping</p>
        <p>the car creates downforce by the angle of the cars body, which directs the underside air up and creates downforce</p>
        <h1>car weight</h1>
        <p>average family cars are around 2500 lbs, while a the average f1 car weighs 1750 lbs. now even though its not that much of a difference, the enginiers are incredibly smart and so they came up with a solution to add to the speed, they put the engine in the back of the car, this helps to reduce the amout of space in the front of the vehicle so that its easier to make the body of the car angled down more to create more downforce, also if the weight is towards the back it makes stering the car easier.</p>
        <h1>car shape</h1>
        <p>the shape of the car adds to the downforce making it faster, it creates even more downforce by having a domnward angle first of all, second of all the wing can also add to the downforce by catching the wind and forcing it to counteract the upward force, third of all cirtain other angles and slits and bumps on the cars body. look at the bugatti bolide for exampe</p>
