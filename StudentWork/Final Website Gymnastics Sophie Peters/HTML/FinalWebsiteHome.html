             <p> Gymnastics is an olympic sport that has four events. For girls, these four events are: 
            Floor, Vault, Uneven Bars, And Balance Beam. For boys, these events are: Floor, Pommel horse, Vault, Horizontal High Bar, Parallel Bars, and Rings. These events need quite a lot of stamina and endurance to do. This website contains information on the girls events: Floor, Beam, Bars, And Vault. </p>

        <p> The sport of gymnastics is very fun, but requires a lot of skill. I am a gymnast at Castle Rock Chameleon Gymnastics, (Near
            The Outlets and King Soopers) My personal favorite event is floor. My best skill on the floor is a roundoff back tuck, ( A cartwheel thingy with a backflip at the end.) I HATE beam. It is very unsafe, and without skill, you could injure yourself, and on a high beam, it could be extremely bad (but this is VERY unlikely, luckily). Speaking of my ranking of events, these are my favorite events listed from favorite to least favorite.
