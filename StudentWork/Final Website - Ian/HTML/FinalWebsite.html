        <p>Everyday, you wake up and make a choice. What do I want to do today? How am I going to get to work/school? And yet it may feel as if every day is the same, repeating over and over again. Though this may be how it feels or seems, but the Earth is constantly changing around us, though we don't feel it.</p>

            <li>One way to help protect this beautiful planet is cleaning up  litter. If you see litter on the sidewwalk or gutter pick it up.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Anouther way to help protect Earth is to walk or bike your morning commute. This will reduce the amount of carbon emissions exerted by cars.</li>
            
            <br>
            <li>Use recycled plastics. Using recycled plastics wether it be from the ocean or just reused plastic it will help reduce the amount of plastic that needs to be produced.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Use recycled plasctics.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Recycle any and all products that say to recycle in order to prevent waste.</li>
            <p class="Protect">The Earth is a beautiful planet that we all live on. Yet everyday we mistreat it. Everytime you use your car for your commute you are putting harmful chemicals into the atmosphere. Everytime you don't you save gas from being burned. It would be a better option to walk or ride a bike to get more exercise as well.</p>

        <h2 class="Choice">It's Your Choice</h2>

        <div class="Choicetwo">
        <p>When you choose to ride a bike or walk to your destination you save the planet from 411 grams per mile. That's a lot when your destination could be 20 or 30 miles away.<br> I know it may seem like it wouldn't matter or make an impact, becuase there are so many other people driving their cars for their commute, but every little bit helps.</p>
