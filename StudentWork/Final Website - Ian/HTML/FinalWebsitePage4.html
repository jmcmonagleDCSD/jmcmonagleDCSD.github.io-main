Mamals are vertebrates with hair, they give live birth and don't lay eggs. Amphibians are small vertevrates that require water to survive, they lay eggs. Arachnids all have eight legs and don't have antennaes, they lay eggs. Cnidrians are soft-bodied animals that have stingers. Birds are vertebrates animals that have feathers, wings, and beaks, they lay eggs. Fish are aquatic vertebrates that have gills, no limbs, they lay eggs. Mollucks are animals that have a mantle or mass of soft flesh that covers the soft body thay lay eggs.

    <h2 class="many">So Many</h2>
    <p class="species">There are so many different types of animals that live on this Earth too. Their homes and habitats are constantly being destroyed for purposes of building structures. We need to protect thees creatures and make sure that they don't go extinct because of our actions. there are over five billion animal species that have gone exctinct. Once an animal goes exctinct that means that they no longer exist. They can't be found anywhere on Earth and we assume that they have all died out. That is so sad because most of the species that have gone extinct are because of humans hunting them down to single digit numbers and disrubting the circle of life. </p>
