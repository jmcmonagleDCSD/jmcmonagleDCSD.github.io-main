        <p>The Bad Seed DLC tells the story of the gardens the king of high peak caslte had. It also tells up about the man who took care of all of the lands of lush grass and lovely sights. These sencic sights were used to entertain guests of the king,
            but then the Malaise struck effecting every thing... even the plants making mushrooms take on more human like shapes, turned vense fly traps into huge ones snacking on more than just unsuppecting insects..

        <h1>Lore summary</h1>

        <p>The basic premisise of the Bad Seed DLC tells a story about the gardener, the man who took care of all of the gardens bedfore the Malaise. It's lore is more based on what happened to the gardener and his gardens. Well..  
            the gardener had gotten inprisoned for no apparent reason it seems, him not wanting to suffer anymore he hung himself with a plant in hand. But for the lands they were mostly thriving the mushrooms growing into human like things, water spreading everywhere making 
            all of the plants bigger and better than before.
