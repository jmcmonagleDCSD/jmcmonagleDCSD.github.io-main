        <img class="2wea" src="../IMAGES/daggers.png" alt="daggers">
        <br><br> <p>These dagger are really good for fast moving weapons but when I've used them they don't do a lot of damage. </p>
        <img class="3wea" src="../IMAGES/clawsythw.png" alt="claw">
        <br><br> <p>I LOVE this weapon butt it does have a big wind up time thte you have to prepare for so it might not be the best if you like faster weapons. </p>
        <img class="4wea" src="../IMAGES/pin.png" alt="pin">
        <br><br> <p>This is a good basic one but you have to have the Castlevania DLC to get it, I like it because it has the bleed affect on it no matter the grade. </p>
        <img class="5wea" src="../IMAGES/bone.png" alt="bone">
        <br><br> <p>I like this one because it's aheavy hitter without a big wind up time and on the thrid hit you do a spin move that does damage and is fun to watch. </p>
        <img class="6wea" src="../IMAGES/broadsword.png" alt="broadsword">
        <br><br> <p>This one I don't really think is good nor bad it's a nice heavy hitter but it's to slow for me. </p>
        <img class="7wea" src="../IMAGES/noobsword.png" alt="noobsword">
        <br><br> <p> This is just the started sword you get its not good nor bad like the broadsword.</p>
        <img class="8wea" src="../IMAGES/greensword.png" alt="greensword">
        <br><br> <p>I like this one when I can get it because it has a poison effect and is fast and does good damage. </p>
