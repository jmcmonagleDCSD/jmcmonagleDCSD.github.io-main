            <!-- what it is -->
            
            <p>when running Cross Country your age determines the distance that you run. There are certain courses that can be really flat or hilly and it might be rainy or snowy but either way you  have to run. there are special shoes for cross country that have holes for spikes that help you stay standing and they can even have a plate in them that propels you</p>
