        <h1>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</h1>

        <p>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege (Siege) is a 5v5 fast paced First Person Shooter (FPS) game. In siege there are a total of 70 operators you can play.</p>

        <p>An operator is someone that has unique gadgets and abilities designated to that operator and that operator only. Operators can also have different guns than others, but not every operator has its own unique gun. The operator Ying, can throw her ability called the "Candela" to blind the other oponents, making it easy for her to push into site without having to worry about being shot. Her goggles make it so she is not blinded by her own ability.</p>

        <h1>Basics:</h1>

        <p>In siege there are 2 teams. Attacking, and Defending.</p> 
        <ol>
            <li>Attacking: When attacking, There will be a map, a map that has a building. Attackers will spawn on the exterior of the building and enter the building. Attackers have to use there drones that have a camera on them to drone into the building and locate the bombs. Once the bombs are located, Attackers will then enter the building, making sure it is clear and make it to the site. In order for the Attacking team to win, they have to either clear the whole defending team, or defuse the bombs before they blow up within a designated time. It takes roughly 8 seconds to defuse a bomb. Make sure your teammates have your back so you can have no problem defusing. </li><br>

            <li>Defending: When defending, you have to use your operator to set up traps to prevent the Attackers from entering the site. You also need to be looking for drones so they don't know what operator you are playing. Various operators such as Frost, Thorn, Lesion, Kapkan, Fenrir, etc. When an attacker is starting to defuse a bomb, you can listen to where they are because when someone is planting the defuser you can hear the typing and some beeping noises to tell where they are. In a situation where they plant the defuser, you have roughly 30 seconds to locate it and counter defuse it. Make sure the coast is clear and you wont get shot. If you can clear the whole team, then you should have time to counter defuse! Just make sure that you can save the timme because you need around 7 seconds out of the 30 seconds to counter defuse so be fast! </li>

            </ol>

            <h1>Ranked:</h1>

            <p>In ranked you will play a 5v5 first to 4 round wins fast paced game. There are 8 ranks you can get in siege. I will now rank them all from the highest rank to the lowest rank.</p>

            <ol>

            <li>Champion</li>
            <li>Diamond</li>
            <li>Emerald</li>
            <li>Platinum</li>
            <li>Gold</li>
            <li>Silver</li>
            <li>Bronze</li>
            <li>Copper</li>
            </ol>


            <p>When in ranked, you need to win a consecutive amount of mathces in a row to rank up. When you win a match in the lower ranks you get roughly 20RP RP stands for "Ranked Points" In each rank you need 100 ranked points to rank up. Also in each rank there are 5 divisions in each rank. For example: Copper V, Copper IV, Copper III, Copper II, and Copper I. Once you rank up into Bronze from copper I, you will be placed in Bronze V. And the same pattern will then repeat.</p>
